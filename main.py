The goal is to eliminate all aliens before they reach the bottom.

Features:
- Player-controlled spaceship with smooth movement
- Alien fleets that move and descend over time
- Laser projectiles for attacking aliens
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses
- Collision detection for shooting and alien movement

This game is developed as a fun and interactive project using Python
and Pygame, focusing on game mechanics, animations, and user interactions.
